This is part 1 of the Recursion project in the "A Little Bit of Computer Science" section of the vanilla JavaScript 
course in The Odin Project. Part 1 tests our understanding of Recursion by tackling a classic problem: the Fibonacci 
Sequence. The assignment is to solve it both iteratively and recursively using vanilla JavaScript.
